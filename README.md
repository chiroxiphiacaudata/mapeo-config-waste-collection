# Mapeo custom config to collect data about waste collection

This is the config (categories, icons and questions) used to collect data about waste collection using Mapeo app.
These configurations are codesigned with the community, teachers, and students at Elinkine Primary School, [Elinkine](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=Elinkine#map=12/12.5092/-16.6611), Senegal, to collect data on the presence of disposable and non-disposable waste in the community as part of an environmental education and awareness project.
